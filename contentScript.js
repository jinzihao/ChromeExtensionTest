// According to https://piazza.com/class/jqo8q481kfe1u4?cid=156, what I need to do is simply call alert():
alert("This is a webpage at " + window.location.href);
// I can also modify the DOM, like this:
// document.body.innerHTML = "<h1>This is a webpage at " + window.location.href + "</h1>" + document.body.innerHTML;
